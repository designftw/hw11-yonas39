    <h1>Animation Writeup</h1>
    <article>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Fade-in animation for the title(logo):</strong>I Added a
          fade-in animation to the "Let's Chat" title, making it gradually
          appear when the page loads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Help modal entrance and exit animation:</strong> I Added
          entrance and exit animations to the help modal, such as sliding in
          from the top and sliding out back to the top when closing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Button hover animations:</strong> I Added a subtle scaling
          animation for all buttons when hovered, making them slightly bigger to
          indicate interactivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Chat message entrance animation:</strong> I Added a slide-in
          and fade-in animation for new chat messages, making them appear
          smoothly as they are added to the chat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Resize background color animation:</strong> I added a media
          query to change the background color of my chat app. I used animation
          to smoothly adjust the app's background color when the screen size
          changed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> The background color:</strong> I added animation to change
          the background color of the message board when the user hovers over
          the message board.
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
          <strong> Search results dropdown animation:</strong> I Added a
          slide-down animation for the search results dropdown
          (autocomplete-container) to smoothly reveal the suggested usernames.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Typing indicator animation: </strong> I Added a typing
          indicator animation to the input field when the user is typing a
          message, such as a pulsing dot or expanding/contracting underline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Read indicator animation:</strong> I Added a brief fade-in
          and scaling animation to the read indicator (double checkmark) when a
          message has been read, to make it more noticeable.
        </li> -->

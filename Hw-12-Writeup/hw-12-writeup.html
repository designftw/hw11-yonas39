      <h2>Second and Final Submission Plan</h2>
      <p>
        For the second and final assignment, I plan to make Some changes to the
        design based on feedback and user testing. The following are some of the
        changes I plan to implement:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Adding Back and Done Buttons:</strong>
          I plan to make my app more user-friendly by adding back-and-done
          buttons as seen on the prototype and ensure they function correctly.
          These will improve Usability and provide users with a clear way to
          navigate through different sections of the site. Furthermore, I will
          add more descriptions to the help so that users can understand the
          purpose of different features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Organizing the Settings:</strong> I will add more user
          options to the settings section. In addition to language, I will add
          other settings options that users may find helpful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Removing Certain Features: Since Phone call is beyond the scope of
          this assignment, I have decided not to pursue that feature from the
          Figma design. This will help to simplify the design and make it more
          manageable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Improving Aesthetics:</strong> I will improve the overall
          aesthetic of the design by adding necessary icons and descriptions.
          This will help users better understand the purpose of different
          features and improve the site's overall visual appeal.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong> Dropping Some Figma Prototypes:</strong> Based on feedback
          from user testing, I have decided to drop two of the Figma prototypes
          and pursue the one users found easier to interact with. Specifically,
          users found selecting the language once and translating all incoming
          texts was more efficient. These will improve Efficiency, learnability
          and streamline the user experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I believe that these changes will significantly improve the usability,
        functionality, and aesthetics of the final design. I will continue to
        test and refine the design as I work towards completing the final
        assignment.

      <h2>Halfway Submission Report</h2>
      <p>
        For the halfway point milestone, I have implemented the Google Cloud API
        translation in my code using the Axios library. This implementation
        allows users to select a target language from a list of options. Then it
        translates messages from the source language to the target language
        using the Google Translate API. I obtained an API key to access the
        Google Translate API and stored it in a constant variable called
        API_KEY. This API key is required to request the API and receive
        translation responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my code, I defined a method called translateMessage that takes
        message content as an argument and sends a POST request to the Google
        Translate API with the message content and the target language. The
        response from the API is then used to update the translatedText property
        in the data object.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also defined another method called translateAllMessages that iterates
        over all messages and uses the translateMessage method to translate each
        message. This method is called when the user selects a new target
        language from the dropdown list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementing the Google Cloud API translation in my code is a
        significant milestone toward completing the final assignment. It
        demonstrates the basic functionality of the translation feature and
        provides a solid foundation for further development and refinement.
        Additionally, the implementation of the API translation shows my ability
        to integrate third-party APIs into my code, which is an essential skill
        in modern web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, implementing the Google Cloud API translation in my code
        represents an appropriate halfway point toward completing the final
        assignment. It demonstrates significant progress in implementing the
        essential components and features of the site and provides a solid
        foundation for further development and refinement.

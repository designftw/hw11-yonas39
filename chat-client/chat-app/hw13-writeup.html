      <h1>Chat Application Design Description</h1>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Communication is a crucial aspect of any community or organization. The
        problems that needed to be addressed were an interactive and
        user-friendly platform for real-time conversation and interaction that
        solves the challenge of understanding messages sent in different
        languages.
      </p>

      <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The provided design is an interactive, real-time chat interface that
        addresses the problems stated above. It is a Vue.js-based design that
        allows users to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Send Messages:</strong> Users can type and send messages in
          real time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Edit Messages:</strong> A user can edit their own messages
          after sending them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Like Messages:</strong> Messages can be liked, providing a way
          to react to a message.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Read Confirmation:</strong> The design also includes a read
          confirmation feature that indicates when a message has been read.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Translate Messages:</strong> Messages sent in a different
          language can be translated to the user's preferred language, breaking
          language barriers and improving understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Profile Pictures:</strong> The design allows users to add or
          change their profile pictures.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        The design uses Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework. Each feature
        is represented as a Vue component. The 'like', 'read', 'edit message',
        and 'translation' functionalities are handled by individual Vue
        components, and these components interact with the main chat interface
        to reflect changes in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chat interface also includes a form for sending messages. When a
        message is sent, it gets added to the list of existing messages and the
        update is made in real time. The chat interface also shows a timestamp
        for each message, enhancing the user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design also includes a profile picture component. Users can choose
        to add or change their profile picture. The profile picture is displayed
        next to the user's name in the chat interface, making it easy for users
        to identify each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The translation feature is particularly noteworthy. When a message is
        sent in a different language, the 'translateMessage' Vue function is
        activated. This function uses a language detection and translation API
        to translate the message to the user's preferred language. The
        translated message is then displayed in the chat interface. This feature
        breaks language barriers and improves understanding among users who
        speak different languages. Suppose the user wants to opt out of
        translation. In that case, they can select 'none' from the setting
        'translate to' option or opt out of translating the languages they
        understand by choosing one or multiple languages from the 'Preserve
        original for' setting option. If the users want a guide on using the
        chat app, they can check the help menu provided in the setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the user can change the chat mode by using the toggle
        button on the screen. And also choose their choice of chat channel in
        public chat.
